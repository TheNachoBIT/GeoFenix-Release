# GeoFenix-Release
Temporary Repository for GeoFenix Engine until its Open Source.

GeoFenix is a 2D/3D Game Engine, which goal is to run stuff as fast and as light as possible for computers. This specifically is for Geometry Dash and one of my games, RetroFunk.
At the moment the code for this is Close Source because i want to release it with more features such as UI, Sounds, Physics, etc.
